Hi thank you for installing TiktEasy. I'm very very greatful. Windows may flag it as a virus (i DO NOT have the money to sign my app ((currently!!!))) If you feel comfortable with going on with the install you can expect to have INSTANTANEOUS reaction timing with the app triggers.
If you have any questions please leave a comment on my github, and report any bugs (if its big enough you may get pro for life!!) Again,Thank you very much.
